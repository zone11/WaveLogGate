# CAT and WSJT-X Bridge for Wavelog

#### Prerequisites
* [FLRig](http://www.w1hkj.com/) properly SetUp to your TRX (if you want to use the CAT-Feature. It's optional!)
* WSJT-X (if you want to use the automatic logging from WSJT-X/Z/Y / FLDigi / Tool which produces UDP-Log-Packets)
* WaveLog-Account on any WaveLog instance
* HTTPS (SSL) has to be enabled for Wavelog to use WLGate

#### WARNING // IMPORTANT! (When using AppleSilicon Mac)
If you use a newer mac (with M1,M2,M3, etc.) apple changed their policy for unsigned Apps.
There's a workaround available, but you need the Terminal aka Shell for that.
Instructions:
1. Download Binary/DMG
2. Copy Binary/DMG to Application-Folder
3. Launch Terminal.app
4. Type in the following:
   - `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/WaveLogGate.app`
   - Launch the Application (should launch now)

#### Setup:
1. Download Binary
2. Start Binary (for Windows: Start Binary and after that you have a NEW Binary. One can delete the old one)
3. Fill in informations:
  * WAVELog-URL including index.php (if you setted it up with that)
  * API-Key (from Wavelog / Right Menu / API-Keys)
  * Station-ID (from Wavelog / Right Menu / See Stationlocations / small badge with station-ID)
4. If you're running FLRig on the same machine put 127.0.0.1 to FLRig-Host and 12345 to FLRig Port and enable it.
5. Click "Test" - Button becomes green if working, Red with detailled issue below, when faulty.
6. Click "Save" if everything is okay

#### WSJT-X (and derivates) SetUp:
Go To WSJT-X-Settings // Reporting
Enable "Secondary UDP Server" like shown in the picture. Do NOT set "UDP Server" (above) to the same Port!

#### Features
* When clicking on a spot in WaveLog-Bandmap your TRX with QSY to the Spot.
* If you log a (non WSJT-X) QSO first go to "Stations Tab" and chose "WLGate" as Radio. After that Band/Mode/QRG will be automatically taken from your Rig into the QSO-Fields
* When clicking the loupe at Live-QSO/Post-QSO Wavelog will automaticly lookup the Spot behind the QRG (if there's a spot)

Enjoy
